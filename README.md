# Dependencies
Small solution created to traverse stored procedures looking for dependencies.

Was born out of the need to find out how stored procedures were dependent on tables, views, and/or other stored procedures. 

Worked on a project that was heavily dependent on stored procedures, where stored procedures called other stored procedures that in turn called other stored procedures. Figuring this out via the code became very difficult and so this project was created.
